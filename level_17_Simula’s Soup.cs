// Define an enum for a food type with values: soup, stew and gumbo
// Define a separate enum for ingredients: mushrooms, chicken, carrots, potatoes
// Define a separate enum for seasoning: spicy, salty, sweet

// Make a tuple variable to represent a soup composed of the three above enumeration types.

// Let the user pick a type, main ingredient, and seasoning from the allowed choices and fill the tuple with the results.
// Hint: You could give the user a menu to pick from or simply compare the
// user’s text input against specific strings to determine which enumeration value represents their choice.

// When done, display the contents of the soup tuple variable in a format like “Sweet Chicken Gumbo.”
// You don’t need to convert the enumeration value back to a string. Simply displaying an
// enumeration value with Write or WriteLine will display the name of the enumeration value.)
